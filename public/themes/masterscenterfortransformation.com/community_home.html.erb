            <p>We all want to live a deeper, more meaningful life.<br /> And for some of us there is a burning urgency to <br /><i>wake up</i> to What-Really-Matters, to embody a life<br /> free from illusion and pretense, a life as vital and <br />grounded as it is spiritually deep. </p>
            <p>But how do we actually <i>do</i> that? When there's so much information out there <br />and so many teachers, how do you know when you've found the real deal? </p>
